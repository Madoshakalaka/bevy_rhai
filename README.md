## What is Bevy Rhai?

Bevy Rhai is an easy way to integrate and use [Rhai] with [Bevy]. It provides
everything you need to get started, all you need to do is write the APIs and run
the scripts.

This is very early on in development and so stuff might be missing, feel free to
open an issue or PR if you want to see something added. At the moment,
everything here is from using the plugin in a personal project.
